The backend validates the data and stores it in MySQL.

The dashboard displays all feedbacks with filtering and sorting options.

Statistics are automatically updated in real-time when new feedbacks are added.

Data visualization with charts for better insights.

Export feedback data to Excel or PDF.

Email or SMS notifications for new feedback.

Multi-role system (Admin/User).
